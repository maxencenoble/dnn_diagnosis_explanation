# High Dimensional and Deep Learning

## Presentation :

 

The main theme of the course is learning methods, especially deep neural networks, for  processing  high dimensional  data, such as signals or images. We will cover the following topics:

 

* Neural networks and introduction to deep learning: definition of neural networks, activation functions, multilayer perceptron, backpropagation algorithms, optimization algorithms, regularization  
**Application** : [Implementation of a mlp with one layer with `Numpy`](https://github.com/wikistat/High-Dimensional-Deep-Learning/tree/master/BackPropagation)


* Convolutional neural networks: convolutional layer, pooling, dropout, convolutional network architectures (ResNet, Inception), transfer learning and fine tuning, applications for image or signal classification.  
**Application** : [Image classification on *MNIST* and *CatsVsDogs* data with `Tensorflow`](https://github.com/wikistat/High-Dimensional-Deep-Learning/tree/master/ImageClassification)


* Encoder-decoder, Variational auto-encoder, Generative adversarial networks


* Functional decomposition on splines, Fourier or wavelets bases: cubic splines, penalized least squares criterion, Fourier basis, wavelet bases, applications to nonparametric regression, linear estimators and nonlinear estimators by thresholding, links with the LASSO method.


* Anomaly detection for functional data: One Class SVM, Random Forest, Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor. Applications to  anomaly detection in functional data.

-------------

**Objectives** :


At the end of this module, the student will have understood and be able to explain (main concepts):


* Using  deep learning methods for  classification in high dimension  
* Classification of signal and images
* Estimation of the prediction error
* Dimension reduction by projections onto orthonormal bases
* Anomaly detection
* Application of  deep learning methods on real data sets


The student will be able to:

* Fit a deep neural network for signal or image classification 
* Implement deep learning methods in high dimension on real data sets with the software Python  or R’s libraries.

## Evaluation

* written exam (50 %) - 09/12/2020

* project (oral presentation 25% - 22/01/2021 + notebook (25%) <br>The main of this project is to apply the knowledge you acquired during this course by:

    * Selecting a deep learning algorithm you haven't seen in this course.
    * Explaining how this algorithm works (oral presentation).
    * Apply these algorithm on a dataset and explain their performances (notebook and oral presentation).

You can choose a deep learning algorithm among the following list. <br>
This list is not exhaustive and you can suggest other algorithms (that's actually a good idea). <br>
Also, the code proposed on those examples are not necessarily the official code nor the one propose by the authors. <br>
